Molecular docking is a technique used in computer simulations to find out how two molecules might interact with each other, usually one being a small molecule like a drug and the other a bigger one like a protein. This technique is really important in discovering new drugs because it helps scientists understand how a drug might work with its target, which is usually a protein (Meng et al., 2011).

 

The process starts by figuring out the active site of the protein. The active site is the spot on the protein where the small molecule is most likely to stick. This spot has a specific shape and certain properties that decide how well the small molecule can fit and stick to it (Morris & Lim-Wilby, 2008).

 

After finding the active site, the small molecule is then tested in the computer to see how it might fit into this site. Different computer programs try many different positions and angles of the small molecule to see which one sticks the best (Trott & Olson, 2010). The computer checks things like how strong the connection is and whether the shapes match well (Jain, 2003).

 

Molecular docking is really useful because it lets scientists check a lot of different small molecules quickly without needing to make and test them all in the lab. This saves a lot of time and money (Pagadala et al., 2017).

 

Additionally, molecular docking helps scientists understand how drugs work on a deeper level, showing them how the drug changes the protein's activity. This knowledge can help make drugs that work better and are safer (Shoichet et al., 2002).

 

In short, molecular docking is a very important tool in modern drug research. It helps predict how molecules will interact and aids in designing new drugs, which leads to more effective treatments that are customized for individual needs (Ferreira et al., 2015).
